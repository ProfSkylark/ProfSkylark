Hi, I am ProfSkylark
I am a father of a wonderful young son.
I am a hobbyist in cybersecurity that has recently taken the dive into self-learning!
I am currently working on improving my skills and building a portfolio

Fun Facts!
I modified our family computer when I was 9 years old in order to play Rome:TW on higher settings.
I volunteered as red team penetration tester in High School for our IT Admin!  I worked this volunteer role for about a year.
